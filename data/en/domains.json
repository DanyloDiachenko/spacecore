Essentially, it's the address of your website on the global network that enables users to easily find and access your resource. For example, on our site, 'spacecore.pro' is a domain name. <br>Domain names facilitate navigation on the Internet because it's much easier to remember 'spacecore.pro' than an IP address, which can look like a set of numbers (e.g., 192.168.1.1)."

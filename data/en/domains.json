It's essentially your website's address in the global network, allowing users to easily find and access your resource. For example, on our website, 'spacecore.pro' is a domain name. Domain names simplify internet navigation, as it's easier to remember 'spacecore.pro' than an IP address, which might look like a string of numbers (e.g., 192.168.1.1)."

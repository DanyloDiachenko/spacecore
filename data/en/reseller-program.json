Suppose you set a markup of 30% on it, and the tariff's cost on your hosting becomes 26 euros/month. You engage in promoting your hosting and find 15 customers who purchased this tariff and extended it for 12 months. This way, your monthly income per client will be 26 € - 20 € = 6 €. And after a year, for 15 such servers, you'll receive a net income of 6 € * 15 units * 12 months = 1080 €."

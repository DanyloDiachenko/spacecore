Suppose you set a markup of 30%, making the tariff cost 26 euros/month on Your hosting. You start promoting Your hosting and find 15 customers who purchase this tariff and renew it for 12 months. Thus, Your monthly income per customer will be 26 € - 20 € = 6 €. After a year, for 15 such servers, you will receive 6 € * 15 units * 12 months = 1080 € net income."
